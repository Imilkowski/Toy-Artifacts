# 🪧 True Billboarding for RTSCamera 🎥
by Drew - DM @Nintendrew on Highrise or Discord for support

---

This developer module allows you to implement true character billboarding in your Studio project! This means that the character rigs for players and NPCs will always attempt draw at the same perspective, regardless of their position relative to the camera. This can help your characters feel less flat in the world.

Simply add the TrueBillboarding.lua script to an empty game object in your scene to try it out. Happy building!! 😃🏗️🛠️🚧
